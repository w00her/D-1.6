    <p>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Beautiful is better than ugly.</p>
    <p>Explicit is better than implicit.</p>
    <p>Simple is better than complex.</p>
    <p>Complex is better than complicated.</p>
    <p>Flat is better than nested.</p>
    <p>Sparse is better than dense.</p>
    <p>Readability counts.</p>
    <p>Special cases aren&apos;t special enough to break the rules.</p>
    <p>Although practicality beats purity.</p>
    <p>Errors should never pass silently.</p>
    <p>Unless explicitly silenced.</p>
    <p>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</p>
    <p>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</p>
    <p>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you&apos;re Dutch.</p>
    <p>Now is better than never.</p>
    <p>Although never is often better than *right* now.</p>
    <p>If the implementation is hard to explain, it&apos;s a bad idea.</p>
    <p>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</p>
    <p>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let&apos;s do more of those!</p>
    <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; |</p>
